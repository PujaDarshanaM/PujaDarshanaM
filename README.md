# 👋 Hi there, I'm Puja 

Thanks for stopping by! I’m a Health Informatics graduate student at Indiana University with a background in Dentistry. My early training as a dental surgeon gave me a firsthand look at the gaps in care delivery—now, I aim to close those gaps using data analytics and machine learning. Through academic and research roles, I’ve built experience across healthcare data modeling, machine learning, data integration, and clinical research operations. I’ve contributed to machine learning tools for dental research, working on developing an app for forecasting models for wound healing, and implemented data pipelines that support interoperability across systems. I’m passionate about leveraging AI and machine learning to develop tools that support early prediction, prevention, and better healthcare delivery.
